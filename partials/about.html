		<p> Hi, my name is James Juhyun Oh. I was born in South Korea and moved to Southern California<br>
		when I was five years old. I am currently a senior in college and looking to get hired full time!
		</p>
		<p> I've changed majors a couple times, from Computer Science to Electrical Engineering then finally settling <br>
		in between to Computer Engineering. I'm fascinated by all layers of the computer, ranging from computer architecture, 
		<br> to writing software applications and even to networking.
